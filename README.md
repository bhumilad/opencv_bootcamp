## 📌 About OpenCV  
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is one of the most widely used computer vision libraries in the world.  
It powers applications across industries like:  

- 🔬 **Healthcare** – medical image analysis, diagnostics  
- 🚗 **Automotive** – self-driving cars, lane/obstacle detection  
- 🎥 **Entertainment** – AR/VR, motion tracking, VFX  
- 📱 **Technology** – face recognition, biometrics, gesture recognition  
- 🏭 **Manufacturing** – defect detection, quality control  
- 🛰️ **Aerospace & Defense** – satellite imaging, surveillance

## 🎯 Topics Covered in Bootcamps  

Throughout the bootcamps, I worked on hands-on projects and learned concepts such as:  

- ✅ Image processing (filters, transformations, thresholding)  
- ✅ Feature detection (Harris, SIFT, ORB)  
- ✅ Object tracking and recognition  
- ✅ Image segmentation and contours  
- ✅ Camera calibration and 3D vision  
- ✅ Deep learning with OpenCV and DNN module
